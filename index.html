    target="_blank" title="BTS wikipedia">BTS</a>(Korean: 방탄소년단;
    RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the
    Bangtan Boys, is a South Korean boy band that was formed in 2010 and
    debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment. The septet—consisting
    of members <strong><u>Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and
    Jungkook—co-writes and co-produces much of their own output.</strong></u>
    Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres.
    Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on
    the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth and coming of
    age, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism.
    Their work also often references literature and psychological concepts
    and includes an alternative universe storyline.</p>
