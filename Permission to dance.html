  <p style="margin-top:35px;">
  It's the thought of being young<br>
  When your heart's just like a drum<br>
  Beating louder with no way to guard it<br>
  When it all seems like it's wrong<br>
  Just sing along to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elton_John" target="_blank" title="Elton John wikipedia">Elton John</a><br>
  And to that feeling, we're just getting started<br>
  When the nights get colder<br>
  And the rhythms got you falling behind<br>
  Just dream about that moment<br>
  When you look yourself right in the eye, eye, eye<br>
  Then you say</p>
  <p style="margin-top:35px;">I wanna dance<br>
  The music's got me going<br>
  Ain't nothing that can stop how we move yeah<br>
  Let's break our plans<br>
  And live just like we're golden<br>
  And roll in like we're dancing fools<br>
  We don't need to worry<br>
  'Cause when we fall we know how to land<br>
  Don't need to talk the talk, just walk the walk tonight<br>
  'Cause we don't need permission to dance</p>
